	abstract = {What does it mean to be a good thinker? Which virtues work together in someone who possesses good intellectual character? Although recent research on virtues has highlighted the benefits of individual intellectual virtues, being an excellent thinker is likely a function of possessing multiple intellectual virtues. Specifically, a good thinker would both recognize one’s intellectual shortcomings and possess an eagerness to learn driven by virtues such as love of knowledge, curiosity, and open-mindedness. Good intellectual character may only successfully manifest when individuals possess not just one or a few intellectual virtues, but a larger set of such virtues to different degrees. However, little is currently known about what combination of virtues are necessary for good thinking. We argue that it is important to identify and clarify the nature of the good thinker and outline a profile methodology for achieving this goal. This approach characterizes the good thinker in terms of a profile of multiple intellectual virtues. Understanding this profile can allow greater insight into the extent to which people possess such a profile, and the potential for societal benefits of educating for these qualities.},

	abstract = {Interest in identifying latent growth profiles to support the psychological and social-emotional development of individuals has translated into the widespread use of growth mixture models ({GMMs}). In most cases, {GMMs} are based on scores from item responses collected using survey scales or other measures. Research already shows that {GMMs} can be sensitive to departures from ideal modeling conditions and that growth model results outside of {GMMs} are sensitive to decisions about how item responses are scored, but the impact of scoring decisions on {GMMs} has never been investigated. We start to close that gap in the literature with the current study. Through empirical and Monte Carlo studies, we show that {GMM} results—including convergence, class enumeration, and latent growth trajectories within class—are extremely sensitive to seemingly arcane measurement decisions. Further, our results make clear that, because {GMM} latent classes are not known a priori, measurement models used to produce scores for use in {GMMs} are, almost by definition, misspecified because they cannot account for group membership. Misspecification of the measurement model then, in turn, biases {GMM} results. Practical implications of these results are discussed. Our findings raise serious concerns that many results in the current {GMM} literature may be driven, in part or whole, by measurement artifacts rather than substantive differences in developmental trends.},

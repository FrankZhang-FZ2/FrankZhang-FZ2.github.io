Qilin Zhang received his BS from the University of Minnesota and his MA from Wake Forest. He is interested in leveraging the power of psychology research to add to the prosociality and cooperation in society. His current research focuses on answering 3 general questions, 1) Who are the moral exemplars, how did they become so, and does their morality contribute to their well-being; 2) How to accurately measure moral (e.g. compassion, fairness, and respect) and intellectual traits (e.g. open-mindedness and intellectual charity); 3) When do people decide to change their moral and intellectual characters and how to promote them through interventions? When he's not tackling these head-scratchers, Qilin likes going on a good hike, playing basketball, hanging out with friends at car meets, or sometimes going to karaoke.

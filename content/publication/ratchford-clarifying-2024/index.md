abstract: What does it mean to be a good thinker? Which virtues work together in someone
  who possesses good intellectual character? Although recent research on virtues has
  highlighted the benefits of individual intellectual virtues, being an excellent
  thinker is likely a function of possessing multiple intellectual virtues. Specifically,
  a good thinker would both recognize oneâ€™s intellectual shortcomings and possess
  an eagerness to learn driven by virtues such as love of knowledge, curiosity, and
  open-mindedness. Good intellectual character may only successfully manifest when
  individuals possess not just one or a few intellectual virtues, but a larger set
  of such virtues to different degrees. However, little is currently known about what
  combination of virtues are necessary for good thinking. We argue that it is important
  to identify and clarify the nature of the good thinker and outline a profile methodology
  for achieving this goal. This approach characterizes the good thinker in terms of
  a profile of multiple intellectual virtues. Understanding this profile can allow
  greater insight into the extent to which people possess such a profile, and the
  potential for societal benefits of educating for these qualities.
